# 🚀 My C++ & DSA Journey

Welcome! 👋
This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of my C++ code, ranging from basic syntax to complex Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

## 📂 What's Inside?
I am constantly adding new code covering these topics:
* **Basics:** Loops, Patterns, Functions, Pointers
* **Data Structures:** Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
* **Algorithms:** Sorting, Searching, Recursion
* **Problem Solving:** Solutions to LeetCode / HackerRank problems

## 💻 Setup & Usage
This code is written in C++ and can be run on any standard compiler (MinGW, G++, etc.).

1.  **Clone the repo:** `git clone https://github.com/lamesahil/CPP-Journey.git`
2.  **Open in VS Code.**
3.  **Run:** Compile any `.cpp` file to see the output.
