# 🚀 My C++ & DSA Journey

Welcome to my coding repository! 👋
This repository documents my progress as I learn **C++** and **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**. I am uploading my daily practice codes, solutions to problems, and notes here.

## 📌 About Me
- **Language:** C++
- **Focus:** Logic Building, DSA, Competitive Programming
- **Tools:** VS Code, Git

## 📂 Repository Structure
I have organized my codes by topic to make navigation easy:

| Folder/File | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `01-Basics` | Variables, Loops, Switch Case, etc. |
| `02-Arrays` | Linear Search, Binary Search, 2D Arrays |
| `03-Strings` | String manipulation and algorithms |
| `04-Functions` | User-defined functions and recursion |
| `05-Pointers` | Memory management and pointer logic |
| `06-OOPs` | Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism |
| `DSA-Problems` | Solutions to LeetCode/CodeChef problems |

## 📈 Progress Log
* **Day 1:** Basics of C++ (Input/Output, Data Types)
* **Day 2:** Control Flow (If-Else, Loops) & Pattern Printing
* **Day 3:** Introduction to Arrays & Linear Search
* *(I will update this list as I learn more)*
